        <h2>The Arctic States</h2>
        <p>The Arctic states are Russia, Canada, the USA, Norway and Denmark, and the sub-Arctic states are Iceland, Sweden and Finland. These 8 countries are part of the Arctic Council, created in 1996 at the initiative of Canada, as permanent members. Thirteen non-Arctic states have observer status and claim to pursue their interests in the region: Great Britain, Germany, India, Spain, Italy, China, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, France, Switzerland and Japan .</p>

<h2>International Organisations</h2>
<p>It is difficult to resolve the territorial disputes due to the fact that there are no formal structures in the Arctic to address security issues. Russia is interested in expanding the powers of the Arctic Council, but the 2009 US Arctic Policy Directive explicitly states that the United States opposes giving it the status of an international organization that makes binding decisions. The Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) and the Council of the Barents Euro-Arctic Region (BEAC) also play only the role of forums in the Nordic region. The Ilulissat Declaration of 2008, the purpose of which was to consider the jurisdictional aspects of the coexistence of the five Arctic states, also did not address security issues.</p>


<h2>Territorial Disputes</h2>
<p>The order of the use of maritime territories in the region is determined by the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Among its key provisions, there is an establishment of an area of 12 nautical miles as the limit of the zone of territorial waters (or territorial sea) of a coastal state that is under its sovereignty and the “exclusive economic zone” of 200 miles. The right of passage of foreign ships through the territorial sea without military purposes is recognized.   </p>
<p>An extended continental shelf of “exclusive economic zone” of a country (more than 200 miles), according to the Convention, can be recognized as a natural extension of land territory to the outer limit of the underwater edge of the continent, within which a coastal nation has jurisdiction over both living and nonliving resources. After ratifying the Convention, countries could file claims to expand their continental shelf for 10 years. It led to the emergence of territorial disputes in the region.  </p>
<p>Thus, in 2001, Russia applied to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf with an application to expand its territory beyond the 200-mile economic zone to the Lomonosov and Mendeleev ridges, which, according to the Russian Federation, are part of the Siberian continental platform. In 2002, the Commission, in response to this request, recommended additional research on the Arctic shelf. In 2015, Russia renewed its claim to extend more than 350 nautical miles (1.2 million km2 of the Arctic Sea shelf) from the coast, supported by new arguments.  </p>
<p>In 2013, the government of Canada submitted an application to expand the boundaries of its exclusive economic zone to the Lomonosov Ridge, considering this area as a continuation of the geological structure of the North American continent, and in 2014, Denmark put forward a claim to the Lomonosov Ridge, believing that it is a continuation of the Greenland shelf.  </p>
<p>The difficulty of resolving this territorial dispute lies in the fact that the Transpolar Sea Route runs through the Lomonosov Ridge. Due to the fact that at the moment only heavy icebreakers are navigable along it, cargo is transported mainly along the Northern Sea Route, defined by Russian legislation as “the historically established national unified transport communication of Russia in the Arctic,” and along the North-Western Sea Route, which runs through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Additionally, there is a seasonal Arctic Bridge route connecting Russia to Canada, which is only navigable for about four months of the year. In connection with the melting of ice, the Transpolar Sea Route has the prospect of becoming the main one, because it does not affect the exclusive economic zones of the Arctic countries.  </p>
<p>There are also a number of other disputes in the Arctic, for example, disagreements between the United States and Canada over the Northwest Sea Route: Canada has adopted a series of laws that consolidated its control over the strait, according to which foreign ships must obtain permission to pass through it, and the United States disputes the legitimacy of these shipping restrictions.

<h2>Russia-NATO Rivalry</h2>
<p>It should be noted that five of the eight member countries of the Arctic Council are members of NATO and that Norway and Finland participate in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (a forum for developing NATO relations with non-member countries in Europe and former Soviet republics) and in the Partnership for Peace initiative, a program of military cooperation between NATO and countries that are not its members. </p>
<p> The Russian Federation joined the EAPC in 1991, and the Partnership for Peace program in 1994. Cooperation was suspended and resumed by NATO twice: after Moscow recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states in 2008 and after the annexation of Crimea to the Russian Federation in 2014. It can be concluded that Russia is at a disadvantage in the Arctic region. Therefore, Russia constantly strengthens its’ positions in the Arctic and collaborates in the region with such strong partner as China. </p>
<p> It is especially important for Russia to defend its’ positions in the Arctic because according to the estimations almost 25% of Russia's gross domestic product comes from north of the Arctic Circle, mainly from hydrocarbons. Thus, in 2014, as a consequence of the 2014 Ukrainian crisis and subsequent sanctions, as well as of the Russia's exclusion from the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable, Russia has officially announced its intention to increase its military presence in the Arctic and  has opened a new Joint Strategic Command called Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command. Moscow has built 475 new military installations, including bases north of the Arctic Circle, as well as sixteen new deep-sea ports. Security is also ensured with the help of the latest sophisticated air defense systems (for example, Pantsir-S1) and anti-ship missiles (Oniks anti-ship cruise missile).</p>
<p> As the Carnegie Institute in Europe states, strengthening of Russia’s positions in the Arctic has significant offensive potential and provokes the Western world to strengthen its positions in order to avoid turning the Arctic into a Russian springboard (плацдарм), from where Moscow will be able to threaten not only the strategic goals of other countries in the region, but also the North Atlantic and Europe.</p>
<p> Russia's advantage in the Arctic is that it has a fleet of more than fifty icebreakers, including the most powerful nuclear icebreaking ships in the world, some of which were developed under Project 22220. In this indicator, Russia ranks first in the world, which is not surprising due to the fact that most of the country’s coastline belongs to the northern seas, where there are practically no ice-free ports. Icebreakers play an important role in maintaining trade. Russia's military presence in the region also includes a network of offensive air assets, a coastal missile system and the new icebreaker Ivan Papanin, which can carry Kalibr cruise missiles.</p>
<p> In 2019 Russia announced plans to link the Northern Sea Route with China's Maritime Silk Road to create a new shipping channel from Asia to Northern Europe. In addition, Russia and China are already cooperating in the development of hydrocarbon resources in the Arctic. Speaking about China, it should be noted that it has intensified its activities in the region since receiving observer status as a “non-Arctic state” in the Arctic Council in 2013. From 2012 to 2017, Beijing has invested almost $90 billion in the Arctic, and in January 2018 it published its first Arctic strategy, China's Arctic Policy, which states that the modern Arctic goes beyond the region and is vital to the interests of the entire international community, including China. In this document, China designated itself as a “near-Arctic state,” although the shortest distance between China and the Arctic is about 1,500 km. China currently operates two icebreakers in the Arctic, but plans to build new ones: the home-made nuclear icebreaker Xuelong 2 (or Snow Dragon 2), which was commissioned in 2019, and the Xuelong, purchased from a Ukrainian company in 1993. These icebreakers are officially used only for research purposes but concern the Pentagon.</p>
<p> The United States argue that they can’t stand aside while Russia is deploying resources in the Arctic region to gain strategic advantage. Retired U.S. Navy Admiral James G. Foggo called the Arctic region “nobody's lake” and called for limiting Russian sovereignty over this “international domain”, particularly the Northern Sea Route.</p>
<p> Therefore, the United States also strengthen their role in the Arctic: increasing diplomatic and military presence, restoring the icebreaker fleet and expanding funding for the coast guard. However, they have at their disposal only two heavy icebreakers, which were built more than 40 years ago: the heavy Polar Star and medium Healy. </p>
<p> The U.S. maintains more than 22,000 active-duty troops in Alaska. Moreover, the USA have also expanded their presence in the Arctic beyond US territory by including the northernmost Thule Air Base in Greenland and by deploying nuclear-capable B1 bombers to Norway's Ørland Air Base. The U.S. maintains more than 22,000 active-duty troops in Alaska. In 2022 the Pentagon has established an Arctic Strategy and Global Resilience Office led by Iris Ferguson as deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Arctic – a new position. The strategy calls for an increased focus on joint exercise with NATO allies and Arctic partners “to improve operational familiarity with the Arctic region, including cold weather operations and interoperability”. It also calls for collaborating with Canada on NORAD (The North American Aerospace Defense Command) air defense modernization.</p>
<p> In response to Russia’s military exercises in July – September 2017 “Vostok-2018” in which about 300 thousand military personnel took part, the United States held NATO the largest since the Cold War military exercises in October – November 2017 – “Trident Juncture 2018”: about 50 thousand people from more than thirty countries took part in them. In May 2020, the US Navy and the UK Royal Navy conducted exercises in the Barents Sea to highlight the importance of the Arctic region in times of climate change. In 2021, the U.S. Army Alaska conducted the Arctic Warrior exercise with the Canadian Air Force with the stated goal of protecting U.S. interests. The Russian Federation responded with large-scale military exercises “Zapad 2021” from September 9 to 16, 2021, in which more than 200 thousand military personnel participated. It is also worth to note such NATO exercises as “Arctic Challenge 2021”, “Cold Response 2022” and “Brilliant Jump 2022” and the US exercises “Arctic Edge 2022” and “Arctic Eagle-Patriot 2022”. In February 2023, a 10-day military exercise of the National Guard “Northern Strike-23” was held in the United States and in September 2023 the Russian Pacific Fleet conducted the “Finval-2023” exercise to protect the Northern Sea Route.</p>

<h2>Indigenous Rights and Participation</h2>
<p>Indigenous peoples have inhabited the Arctic for thousands of years and play a crucial role in policy formulation. Their rights and traditional knowledge are vital in shaping sustainable policies. Indigenous peoples in the Arctic include the Inuit in Greenland, Canada, and parts of Alaska; the Sami in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia; and various indigenous groups in Russia such as the Nenets, Khanty, Evenk, and Chukchi, among others.</p>

<h2>Future Challenges</h2>
<p>The Arctic faces several challenges, including climate change, increased commercial interest in resource exploitation and navigation routes. Balancing these with environmental and indigenous concerns is a key policy challenge. Moreover, as the geopolitical competition intensifies between the United States and NATO on one front, and Russia and China on the other, concerns about the potential militarization of the Arctic are becoming more and more rational. In 2019, at a meeting of the Arctic Council in Rovaniemi (Finland), US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the Arctic “an arena of global power and competition.”</p>
